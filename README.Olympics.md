**Analyzing Olympic Data**

Project Overview:

The "Analyzing Olympic Data" project involves a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data using SQL queries. By leveraging data analysis techniques, this project provides valuable insights into Olympic achievements, player performances, and historical trends. It showcases a range of SQL skills, including joins, subqueries, window functions, and data aggregation.

**Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this project are:

To identify teams that have won the maximum number of gold medals over the years.

To calculate the total number of silver medals for each team and identify the year in which they won the maximum silver medals.

To find the player with the maximum gold medals among those who have never won silver or bronze medals.

To determine, for each year, the player(s) who have won the maximum gold medals and handle ties by listing all player names.

To discover the first instances in which India won gold, silver, and bronze medals, along with the corresponding events and years.

To identify players who have won gold medals in both summer and winter Olympics.

To find players who have won gold, silver, and bronze medals in a single Olympics and display their names along with the year.

To identify players who have won gold medals in consecutive 3 summer Olympics in the same event starting from the year 2000 onwards.

**Data Source:**

The project utilizes Olympic data, including information about athletes, teams, medals, events, and years. The data source is based on historical Olympic records.
